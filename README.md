# Introduction

Let's say we are involuntary time travelers. Somehow landed in the 1950s. It just so happens that we remember every day exchange rates starting on the current date all the way to 1985. Perhaps it was a graph on a newspaper we were holding at the moment of time travel. Or maybe we just have a good memory. Splendid idea, but there is one problem. We are starting with only a few dollars to spare. Far fewer to make this idea worthwhile, unless we make every trade optimally.

That represents our problem. Knowing a chronological collection of exchange rates, what is the optimal strategy of exchanging our currency (let's say it is dollar) with another (again, for the sake of presentation call in a yen). There is also a margin â€” a fraction that is deduced from our money after every exchange.

## A note about machine learning and other ai approaches

It is tempting to use any machine learning approach here. After all, we have a huge array of data we can train on. And in the worst case scenario we overfit the data. And yes, this approach would work. However there are simpler algorithms. Especially algorithms that we can show give optimal answer.

## Brute force

Have I just said there are simpler algorithms with proof of optimality? Well, it is true brute force is extremely rudimentary and will indeed give us optimal answer. Naturally the time complexity would be abysmal. The only reason brute force appears here, is because we will need it in a moment.

Idea is simple. As seen in the code, we are iterating over all possible subsets of points. Each subset represents buy/sell strategies. Which of them are buy, and which are sell is just up to the currency we are starting with.

## Divide and Conquer

The algorithm used is simple Divide and Conquer. It works as follows:

1. If the problem is small, solve it naively (Brute force);
2. Otherwise divide the problem in half, and solve the halves recursively;
3. Knowing all the optimal strategies for each halve we are trying to combine them and picking the best one.

That itself is enough. There is just one subtlety. Our DnC algorithm always returns 4 different strategies. Each with different opening or closing currencies. Why is it so, will be easily visible in the proof.
