# Introduction

Lets say we are involuntary time travelers. Somehow landed in 1950s. It just so happens that we remember every day exchange rates starting on the current date all the way to 1985. Perhaps it is was a graph on a newspaper we were holding at the moment of time travel. Or maybe we just have a good memory. Splendid idea, but there is one problem. We are starting with only few dollars to spare. Far few to make this idea worthwhile, unless we make every trade optymally.

That represents our problem. Knowing a chronological collection of exchange rates, what is the optimal strategy of exchanging our currency (lets say it is dollar) with another (again, for the sake of presentation call in a yen). There is also a margin â€” a fraction that is deduced from our money after every exchange.

## A note about machine learning and other ai approaches

It is tempting to use here any machine learning approach. After all we have a huge array of data we can train on. And in worst case scenario we we overfit the data. And yes, this approach would work. However there are simpler algorithms. Especially algorithms that we can show give optimal answer.
